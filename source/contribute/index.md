Contributions to OpenData are welcome! All of the code is managed through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nivlab/opendata).

<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">How to submit a dataset</h2>
There are three main ways you can submit a dataset for entry to OpenData, which are described in turn below. Note that they are ranked in order of preference, from most preferred to least preferred, by the maintainers of Open Data.

<h3 style="margin: 1.33em 0em 0.5em 0em">1. Fill out the Google form</h3>
Have a dataset to submit? Fill out this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/N87Dqhs73vbfoPec8" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/N87Dqhs73vbfoPec8</a>

<h3 style="margin: 1.33em 0em 0.5em 0em">2. Submit a pull request</h3>
To directly add a dataset yourself, you can open a pull request on Github. First you should fork the OpenData library via GitHub and make modifications on your fork. The OpenData database is written in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">markdown</a> using a standardized, easy-to-copy template. Once your modification is complete, submit a pull request to merge your changes into the docs branch of OpenData. Pull requests will be reviewed by the maintainers.

<h3 style="margin: 1.33em 0em 0.5em 0em">3. Open an issue</h3>
To advertise a dataset for entry into the database, you can open a <a href="https://www.github.com/nivlab/opendata/issues/new" target="_blank">new issue via GitHub</a>. Please provide a link to a repository for the data and, if available, a link to a corresponding manuscript describing the data.
