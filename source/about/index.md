<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">What is the goal of OpenData?</h2>
The goal of this project is simply to make it easier for researchers to find and use publicly available behavioral data as part of research. There's already so much out there that can be used to:

- Test new hypotheses or models
- Calculate effect sizes for power analysis
- Estimate meta-analytic effects across studies

<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">What is the scope of OpenData?</h2>
The scope of this project is to catalogue any and all open datasets involving experimental or cognitive tasks (e.g., Stroop, delay discounting, 2-arm bandits). Datasets involving more naturalistic behaviors are also welcomed. The hard requirement is that trial-level data must be available.
