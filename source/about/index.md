OpenData is a database of publicly available datasets of potential interest to the Niv/Daw labs. We are mostly cataloging datasets involving reinforcement learning & decision making experiment, though we also keep tabs on computational psychiatry experiments and some self-report questionnaires.

To browse the current catalog, follow the links above or use the search bar at the top-right of this page.
