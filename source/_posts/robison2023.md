Data from a study in which N=356 across four experiments (N=130, N=88, N=57, N=81) completed gamified or non-gamified versions of the psychomotor vigilance task. The experiments show that the addition of gamified features (i.e., competition, point systems) can obviate or attenuate time-on-task performance decrements.
