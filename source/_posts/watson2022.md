Data from a study in which N=67 participants across two experiments (N=28, N=39) completed the symmetrical outcome-revaluation task, which consists of an instrumental training phase followed by an outcome-revaluation test phase during which outcome values were either congruent with training value or incongruent (i.e., devalued or upvalued).
