Learning appropriate representations of the reward environment is challenging in the real world where there are many options, each with multiple attributes or features. Despite existence of alternative solutions for this challenge, neural mechanisms underlying emergence and adoption of value representations and learning strategies remain unknown. To address this, we measure learning and choice during a multi-dimensional probabilistic learning task in humans and trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture our experimental observations. We find that human participants estimate stimulus-outcome associations by learning and combining estimates of reward probabilities associated with the informative feature followed by those of informative conjunctions. Through analyzing representations, connectivity, and lesioning of the RNNs, we demonstrate this mixed learning strategy relies on a distributed neural code and opponency between excitatory and inhibitory neurons through value-dependent disinhibition. Together, our results suggest computational and neural mechanisms underlying emergence of complex learning strategies in naturalistic settings.
