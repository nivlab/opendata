Data from a study in which N=108 participants across two experiments (N=18, N=90) completed a variant of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task designed to study how different lengths of initial experience influenced risk-taking behavior during sequential sampling of outcome probabilities. Specifically, the first five (short manipulation) or ten (long manipulation) balloons of the task consisting of 30 balloons were manipulated to induce negative or positive initial experience.
