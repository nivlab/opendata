Data from a study in which N=59 participants completed  an experiment where they incidentally encoded associations between unique objects and repeated scenes. Some scenes typically yielded high reward, whereas  others typically yielded low reward. Memory was tested immediately after encoding or the next day. Overall, reward had only a limited influence on memory, neither enhancing consolidation nor did generalizing to episodically related stimuli.
