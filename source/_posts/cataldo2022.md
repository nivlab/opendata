Data from a study in which N=1,358 participants completed the Beck Depression inventory (BDI) and an emotional memory task. At encoding, participants judged whether positive and negative words were positive or self-descriptive. After a free recall test, participants viewed an equal mix of studied and unstudied words and judged whether each was "old" or "new". participants exhibited a positive memory advantage and its decrease for depression in recall, recognition, and source accuracy. A hierarchical drift diffusion model revealed that higher BDI-II scores are associated with more efficient evidence accumulation for negative words in the recognition and source memory tasks.
