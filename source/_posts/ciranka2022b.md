Data from a study in which N=161 adolescents and young adults (10-26 years of age) completed the marble task, in which participants are asked to draw a marble out of a risky or a safe marble-jar to accumulate as many bonus points as they could. The level of rewards, uncertainty, and social information were manipulated across trials. Risky-choice, social information use, and subjective uncertainty were observed to decrease across development.
