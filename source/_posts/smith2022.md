abstract: 'To effectively navigate their environments, infants and children learn how to recognize events predict salient outcomes, such as rewards or punishments. Relatively little is known about how children acquire this ability to attach value to the stimuli they encounter. Studies often examine childrens ability to learn about rewards and threats using either classical conditioning or behavioral choice paradigms. Here, we assess both approaches and find that they yield different outcomes in terms of which individuals had efficiently learned the value of information presented to them. The findings offer new insights into understanding how to assess different facets of value learning in children.'

Data from a study in which N=72 children completed a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm where they saw five colored shapes followed by either appetitive, aversive, or neutral reinforcers. After the conditioning task, participants completed a behavioral choice task in which they were asked to use information from the conditioning task to approach or avoid appetitive and aversive stimuli.
