abstract: 'Patch foraging presents a sequential decision-making problem widely studied across organisms â€” stay with a current option or leave it in search of a better alternative? Behavioral ecology has identified an optimal strategy for these decisions, but, across species, foragers systematically deviate from it, staying too long with an option or ``overharvesting relative to this optimum. Despite the ubiquity of this behavior, the mechanism underlying it remains unclear and an object of extensive investigation. Here, we address this gap by approaching foraging as both a decision-making and learning problem. Specifically, we propose a model in which foragers 1) rationally infer the structure in their environment and 2) use their uncertainty over the inferred structure representation to adaptively discount future rewards. We find that overharvesting can emerge from this rational statistical inference and uncertainty adaptation process. In a patch leaving task, we show that human participants adapt their foraging to the richness and dynamics of the environment in ways consistent with our model. These findings suggest that definitions of optimal foraging could be extended by considering how foragers reduce and adapt to uncertainty over representations of their environment.'

Data from a study in which N=176 participants completed a stay-switch patch-leaving foraging experiment. Participants adapted their foraging to the richness and dynamics of the environment in ways consistent with rational statistical inference and uncertainty adaptation.
