Data from a study in which N=67 participants completed a multi-arm bandit task in which participants freely explored different unknown environments that contained learnable sequences of events with varying degrees of noise and volatility. Participants' exploratory behavior was guided by learning progress and perceptual novelty, and also an overall tendency to avoid extreme forms of uncertainty.
