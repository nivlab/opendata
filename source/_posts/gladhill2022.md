Previous research has demonstrated that emotional faces affect time perception, however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Earlier attempts focus on effects at the different stages of the pacemaker-accumulator model (clock, memory, and/or decision-making) including, an increase in pacemaker rate or accumulation rate via arousal or attention, respectively, or by biasing decision-making. A visual temporal bisection task with sub-second intervals was conducted in two groups to further investigate these effects; one group was strictly behavioral whereas the second included a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). To separate the influence of face and timing responses, participants timed a visual stimulus, temporally flanked (before and after) by two faces, either negative or neutral, creating three trial-types: Neg→Neut, Neut→Neg, or Neut→Neut. We found a leftward shift in bisection point (BP) in Neg→Neut relative to Neut→Neut suggests an overestimation of the temporal stimulus when preceded by a negative face. Neurally, we found the face-responsive N170 was larger for negative faces and the N1 and contingent negative variation (CNV) were larger when the temporal stimulus was preceded by a negative face. Additionally, there was an interaction effect between condition and response for the late positive component of timing (LPCt) and a significant difference between response (short/long) in the neutral condition. We concluded that a preceding negative face affects the clock stage leading to more pulses being accumulated, either through attention or arousal, as indexed by a larger N1, CNV, and N170; whereas viewing a negative face after impacted decision-making mechanisms, as evidenced by the LPCt.
