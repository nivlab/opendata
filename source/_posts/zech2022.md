Data from a study in which N=1077 participants completed at least once (N=248 participants completed all eight sessions) a smartphone-based approach-avoidance task. Each task consisted of two blocks: one, in which participants had to approach one stimulus type (e.g., happy faces) and avoid the other (e.g., sad faces), and one block in which these instructions were reversed (e.g., push away happy faces and pull sad faces).
