Data from a study in which N=75 participants completed a belief updating task, where they rated their own perceived popularity among hypothetical internship partners and then received feedback about their actual popularity. Participants also completed a number of self-report symptom measures of depression and anxiety (PSWQ, MASQ, STAI, CESD). Higher depression scores were linked to more negative prior beliefs, whereas higher anxiety scores were associated with a negative bias in belief updating.
