Data from a study in which N=1352 participants across six experiments (N=144, N=300, N=156, N=301, N=151, N=300) were shown 18 sequences of 8 binary outcomes, and asked to predict the direction of the 9th (next) outcome in each sequence. Participants were assigned to judge sequences produced by one of three different generators: (1) a random mechanical device; (2) an intentional, goal-directed actor; and (3) a market process. The most common predictions for subsequent events were best described as pragmatic belief updating, expressed as an increasingly strong expectation that a streak of identical signals would repeat as the length of that streak increased. The exception to this pattern was for sequences generated by a random mechanical device with a fixed base rate of 0.50.
