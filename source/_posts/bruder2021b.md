abstract: 'AbstractHigh-performance virtual reality (VR) technology has opened new possibilities for the examination of the reactivity towards addiction-related cues (cue-reactivity) in addiction. In this preregistered study (https://osf.io/4mrta), we investigated the subjective, physiological, and behavioral effects of gambling-related VR environment exposure in participants reporting frequent or pathological gambling (n=31) as well as non-gambling controls (n=29). On two separate days, participants explored two rich and navigable VR-environments (neutral: caf√© vs. gambling-related: casino/sports-betting facility), while electrodermal activity and heart rate were continuously measured using remote sensors. Within VR, participants performed a temporal discounting task and a sequential decision-making task designed to assess model-based and model-free contributions to behavior. Replicating previous findings, we found strong evidence for increased temporal discounting and reduced model-based control in participants reporting frequent or pathological gambling. Although VR gambling environment exposure increased subjective craving, there was if anything inconclusive evidence for further behavioral or physiological effects. Instead, VR exposure substantially increased physiological arousal (electrodermal activity), across groups and conditions. VR is a promising tool for the investigation of context effects in addiction, but some caution is warranted since effects of real gambling environments might not generally replicate in VR. Future studies should delineate how factors such as cognitive load and ecological validity could be balanced to create a more naturalistic VR experience.'
