Computational models of decision making have identified a relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS), both in the general population and in patients, and impairments in perceptual evidence accumulation. Some studies have interpreted these deficits to reflect global disease traits which give rise to clusters of OCS. Such assumptions are not uncommon, even if implicit, in computational psychiatry more broadly. However, it is well established that state- and trait-symptom scores are often correlated (e.g., state and trait anxiety), and the extent to which perceptual deficits are actually explained by state-based symptoms is unclear. State-based symptoms may give rise to information processing differences in a number of ways, including the mechanistically less interesting possibility of tying up working memory and attentional resources for off-task processing. In a general population sample (N = 150), we investigated the extent to which previously identified impairments in perceptual evidence accumulation were related to trait vs stated-based OCS. In addition, we tested whether differences in working memory capacity moderated state-based impairments, such that impairments were worse in individuals with lower working memory capacity. We replicated previous work demonstrating a negative relationship between the rate of evidence accumulation and trait-based OCS when state-based symptoms were unaccounted for. When state-based effects were included in the model, they captured a significant degree of impairment while trait-based effects were attenuated, although they did not disappear completely. We did not find evidence that working memory capacity moderated the state-based effects. Our work suggests that investigating the relationship between information processing and state-based symptoms may be important more generally in computational psychiatry beyond this specific context.
