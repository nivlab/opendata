Data from a study in which N=1492 participants completed a 2-arm bandit task under three conditions: control, observation and advice (order counter-balanced), with each block differing in the social information provided to participants after the 4th trial. Social information always recommended the option with the highest expected reward. Participants also completed the Paranoid Thoughts Scale (R-GPTS) Participants were more likely to immediately follow advice than to copy an observed choice, but this was dependent upon trust in the adviser: highly paranoid participants were less likely to follow advice in the short term.
