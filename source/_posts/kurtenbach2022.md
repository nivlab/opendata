Data from a study in which N=60 participants performed a novel visual go/no-go learning task with deterministic reinforcement and interspersed blocks without feedback. In non2-reinforced task blocks, we found an increased d', indicative of enhanced instrumental performance. Computational modeling showed that this improvement in performance was not due to an increased sensitivity of decision making to learned values, but due to a more cautious mode of responding, as evidenced by a reduction of a general response bias.
