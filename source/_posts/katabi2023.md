ADHD is characterized by a difficulty to act in a goal-directed manner. While most environments require a sequence of actions for goal attainment, ADHD was never studied in the context of value-based sequence learning. Here, we made use of current advancements in hierarchical reinforcement-learning algorithms to track the internal value and choice policy of individuals with ADHD performing a three-stage sequence learning task. Specifically, 54 participants (28 ADHD, 26 controls) completed a value-based reinforcement-learning task that allowed us to estimate internal action values for each trial and stage using computational modeling. We found attenuated sensitivity to action values in ADHD compared to controls, both in choice and reaction-time variability estimates. Remarkably, this was found only for first stage actions (i.e., initiatory actions), while for action performed just before outcome delivery the two groups were strikingly indistinguishable. These results suggest a difficulty in following value estimation for initiatory actions in ADHD.
