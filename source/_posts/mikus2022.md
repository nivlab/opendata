Data from a study in which N=120 participants completed the two-step task after the administration of the dopamine D2/3 receptor antagonist amisulpride. Following administration, participants showed an increase in model-based relative to model-free behavior, whereas the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone had no appreciable effect.
