abstract: 'The purpose of exploration is to reduce goal-relevant uncertainty. This can be achieved by choosing to explore the parts of the environment one is most uncertain about. Humans, however, often choose to avoid uncertainty. How do humans balance approaching and avoiding uncertainty during exploration? To answer this question, we developed a task requiring participants to explore a simulated environment towards a clear goal. We compared human choices to the predictions of the optimal exploration policy and a hierarchy of simpler strategies. We found that participants generally explored the object they were more uncertain about. However, when overall uncertainty about choice options was high, participants avoided objects they were more uncertain about, learning instead about better known objects. We examined reaction times and individual differences to understand the costs and benefits of this strategy. We conclude that balancing approaching and avoiding uncertainty ameliorates the costs of exploration in a resource-rational manner.'

Data from a study in which N=194 participants completed a 2-arm bandit task in which they explored explored four bandits, each containing two decks with different proportions of blue/orange cards. The goal was to learn the difference in proportions of the decks on each table. After exploration trials, participants were tested on their knowledge in which they had to choose the deck with the highest proportion of a rewarding color.
