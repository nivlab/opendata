Data from a study in which N=40 participants completed a physical effort task in which they made choices about whether to work and exert different levels of physical effort to obtain different magnitudes of reward, or whether to take a rest for low reward. Prior to those choices, they also had to decide which information they wanted to see first: how effortful, or rewarding, work would be.
