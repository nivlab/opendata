abstract: 'Some experiences linger in mind, spontaneously returning to our thoughts for minutes after their conclusion. Other experiences fall out of mind immediately. It remains unclear why. We hypothesize that an input is more likely to persist in our thoughts when it has been deeply processed: when we have extracted its situational meaning rather than its physical properties or low-level semantics. Here, participants read sequences of words with different levels of coherence (word-, sentence-, or narrative-level). We probe participants spontaneous thoughts via free word association, before and after reading. By measuring lingering subjectively (via self-report) and objectively (via changes in free association content), we find that information lingers when it is coherent at the narrative level. Furthermore, and an individuals feeling of transportation into reading material predicts lingering better than the materials objective coherence. Thus, our thoughts in the present moment echo prior experiences that have been incorporated into deeper, narrative forms of thinking.'

Data from a study in which N=1280 online participants performed a free association task in which they typed whatever words came to mind, as they came to mind, for 5-minutes. Free association was performed before and after a variety of tasks including reading stories of varying levels of coherence (e.g., intact, sentence-scrambled, word-scrambled).
