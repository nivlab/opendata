OBJECTIVE: Eating disorders (EDs) are a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by disturbed eating patterns. Links have been made between ED symptoms and control-seeking behaviors, which may cause relief from distress. However, whether direct behavioral measures of control-seeking behavior correlate with ED symptoms has not been directly tested. Additionally, existing paradigms may conflate control-seeking behavior with uncertainty-reducing behavior. METHOD: A general population sample of 183 participants completed part in an online behavioral task, in which participants rolled a die in order to obtain/avoid a set of numbers. Prior to each roll, participants could choose to change arbitrary features of the task (such as the color of their die) or view additional information (such as the current trial number). Selecting these Control Options could cost participants points or not (Cost/No-Cost conditions). Each participant completed all four conditions, each with 15 trials, followed by a series of questionnaires, including the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R). RESULTS: A Spearman's rank test indicated no significant correlation between total EAT-26 score and total number of Control Options selected, with only elevated scores on a measure of obsessions and compulsivity (OCI-R) correlating with the total number of Control Options selected (rs = .155, p = .036). DISCUSSION: In our novel paradigm, we find no relationship between EAT-26 score and control-seeking. However, we do find some evidence that this behavior may be present in other disorders that often coincide with ED diagnosis, which may indicate that transdiagnostic factors such as compulsivity are important to control-seeking.
