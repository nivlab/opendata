abstract: 'The study of social learning examines how individuals learn from others by means of observation, imitation, or compliance with advice. However, it still remains largely unknown whether social learning processes have a distinct contribution to choice behavior, independent from non-social trial-and-error learning that often occurs simultaneously. 153 participants completed a reinforcement learning task, where they were asked to make choices to gain rewards. Advice from an artificial teacher was presented on 60% of the trials, allowing us to compare choice behavior with and without advice. Results showed a strong and reliable tendency to follow advice (test-retest reliability ~.73). Computational modeling suggested a unique contribution of three distinct learning strategies: (a) individual learning (i.e., learning the value of actions, independent of advice), (b) informed advice-taking (i.e., learning the value of following advice), and (c) non-informed advice-taking (i.e., a constant bias to follow advice regardless of outcome history). Computational lesion simulations analyses provided specific regression signatures to both informed and non-informed advice taking processes that were then confirmed by empirical data. We discuss the theoretical implications of integrating internal and external information during the learning process.'

Data from a study in which N=153 participants completed a reinforcement learning task across   two sessions, during which they were asked to make choices to gain rewards. Participants were either presented with advice from an artificial teacher (60% of the trials) or not. Participants exhibited a strong and reliable tendency to follow advice above and beyond the effect of individual value   learning.
