Data from a study in which N=153 participants completed a reinforcement learning task across   two sessions, during which they were asked to make choices to gain rewards. Participants were either presented with advice from an artificial teacher (60% of the trials) or not. Participants exhibited a strong and reliable tendency to follow advice above and beyond the effect of individual value   learning.
