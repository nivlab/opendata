Data from a study in which N=101 participants completed a predictive inference task, in which participants had to catch virtual bags of money (for points) dropped from a helicopter, which was hidden behind clouds. The goal was to guess the location of the next bag drop and move a bucket to the predicted location. The task had two contexts which produced surprising locations of bag drops. In one context (change-point) the mean (helicopter) would randomly change position on 12.5% of trials. In the other context (oddball), on 12.5% of trials, the bag location was sampled from a uniform distribution and the mean drifted in accordance with a random walk on each trial.
