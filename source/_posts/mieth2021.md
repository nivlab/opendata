To determine the role of moral norms in cooperation and punishment, we examined the effects of a moral-framing manipulation in a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a costly punishment option. In each round of the game, participants decided whether to cooperate or to defect. The Prisoner's Dilemma game was identical for all participants with the exception that the behavioral options were paired with moral labels ("I cooperate" and "I cheat") in the moral-framing condition and with neutral labels ("A" and "B") in the neutral-framing condition. After each round of the Prisoner's Dilemma game, participants had the opportunity to invest some of their money to punish their partners. In two experiments, moral framing increased moral and hypocritical punishment: participants were more likely to punish partners for defection when moral labels were used than when neutral labels were used. When the participants' cooperation was enforced by their partners' moral punishment, moral framing did not only increase moral and hypocritical punishment but also cooperation. The results suggest that moral framing activates a cooperative norm that specifically increases moral and hypocritical punishment. Furthermore, the experience of moral punishment by the partners may increase the importance of social norms for cooperation, which may explain why moral framing effects on cooperation were found only when participants were subject to moral punishment.
