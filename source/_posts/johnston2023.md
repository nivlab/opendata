Memory is a reconstructive process with biases toward remembering events in line with prior higher orderbeliefs. This can result in events being remembered as more positive or negative than they actually were.While positive recall biases may contribute to well-being, negative recall biases may promote internalizingsymptoms, such as social anxiety. Adolescence is characterized by increased salience of peers and peakincidence of social anxiety. Symptoms often wax and wane before becoming more intractable duringadulthood. Open questions remain regarding expression of biases for social feedback, and how individualdifferences in such biases may contribute to social anxiety across development. Two independent studiesused a novel social feedback and cued response task to assess memory biases and prediction biasesabout being liked or disliked. Our findings revealed a robust positivity bias about memories for socialfeedback, regardless of whether memories were true or false. Moreover, memory bias was associated withsocial anxiety in a developmentally sensitive way. Among adults (Study 1), more severe symptoms of socialanxiety were associated with a negativity bias. During the transition from adolescence to adulthood (Study2), age strengthened the positivity bias in those with less severe symptoms and strengthened the negativitybias in those with more severe symptoms. Biases did not generalize to predictions about social feedback.These studies support a model by which higher order beliefs can infiltrate perceptions of memory for past,but not predictions of future, social events, shaping susceptibility for social anxiety, particularly during thetransition into adulthood.
