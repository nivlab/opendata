Confidence is suggested to be a key component in psychiatry and manifests at various hierarchical levels, from confidence in a decision (local confidence), to confidence about performance (global confidence), to higher-order traits such as self-beliefs. Most research focuses on local confidence, but global levels may relate more closely to symptoms. Here, using a transdiagnostic framework, we tested the relationships between self-reported psychopathology, local and global confidence, and higher-order self-beliefs in a general population sample (N = 489). We show contrasting relationships between confidence and psychopathology dimensions. An anxious-depression dimension related to local and global underconfidence. By contrast, a compulsive-intrusive-thoughts dimension related to increased overconfidence at both levels, and showed a decoupling between (1) higher-order self-beliefs and (2) local and global task confidence. The strongest predictor of mental health was a self-beliefs dimension. This study examines higher-order confidence in relation to psychiatric symptoms fluctuating in the general population. Critically, psychopathological symptoms show distinct associations with confidence.
