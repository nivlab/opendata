Data from a study in which N=425 participants across three experiments (N=147, N=132, N=146) completed a decisions from description paradigm involving gambles over monetary outcomes, physical effort, or mental effort. With monetary gambles, risk attitudes followed the classic fourfold pattern. With both physical and mental effort, however, people exhibited a "flipped" fourfold pattern of risk preferences and were instead risk seeking for increases in effort.
