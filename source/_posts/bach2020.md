#### Predictors of risky foraging behaviour in healthy young people

Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-0867-0

Data from 781 young adults (aged 14-24) who completed a risky foraging task. Sex was found to be the most important predictor of cautious behaviour and performance. Other independent predictors of cautiousness and performance were self-reported daringness, IQ and self-reported cognitive complexity. No evidence for an impact of age or maturation.
