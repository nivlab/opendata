Data from a study in which N=203 participants completed a 2-arm bandit task. After eliciting a biased preference for one of two equally rewarding options, participants could sample freely from both options without rewards. When participants were instructed to rule out alternatives in this phase, they explored the supposedly worse option and then overcome their initial bias. When told to optimize their strategy, however, they exhibited a positive testing strategy resulting in the continued exploitation of the supposedly better option, a bias they maintained in an incentivized choice phase and later judgments.
