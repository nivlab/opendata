abstract: 'Psychological sciences have identified a wealth of cognitive processes and behavioral phenomena, yet struggle to produce cumulative knowledge. Progress is hamstrung by siloed scientific traditions and a focus on explanation over prediction, two issues that are particularly damaging for the study of multifaceted constructs like self-regulation. Here, we derive a psychological ontology from a study of individual differences across a broad range of behavioral tasks, self-report surveys, and self-reported real-world outcomes associated with self-regulation. Though both tasks and surveys putatively measure self-regulation, they show little empirical relationship. Within tasks and surveys, however, the ontology identifies reliable individual traits and reveals opportunities for theoretic synthesis. We then evaluate predictive power of the psychological measurements and find that while surveys modestly and heterogeneously predict real-world outcomes, tasks largely do not. We conclude that self-regulation lacks coherence as a construct, and that data-driven ontologies lay the groundwork for a cumulative psychological science.'

Data from a study in which N=522 participants completed 37 behavioral tasks and 22 self-report surveys. It included measures putatively related to self-regulation including risk-taking, temporal discounting and impulsivity, but also extended into more generic cognitive domains like working memory, information processing, learning, mindfulness, and others. By construction, some putative constructs like impulsivity were evaluated in both surveys and tasks, affording the opportunity to evaluate cross-measure consistency. In addition to these surveys and tasks, participants reported a number of real-world outcomes (e.g., self-reported questions relating to alcohol consumption, mental health, personal finances, etc.).
