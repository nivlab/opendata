Data from a study in which N=522 participants completed 37 behavioral tasks and 22 self-report surveys. It included measures putatively related to self-regulation including risk-taking, temporal discounting and impulsivity, but also extended into more generic cognitive domains like working memory, information processing, learning, mindfulness, and others. By construction, some putative constructs like impulsivity were evaluated in both surveys and tasks, affording the opportunity to evaluate cross-measure consistency. In addition to these surveys and tasks, participants reported a number of real-world outcomes (e.g., self-reported questions relating to alcohol consumption, mental health, personal finances, etc.).
