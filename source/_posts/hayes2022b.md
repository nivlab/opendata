Data from a study in which N=64 participants across two experiments (N=31, N=33) completed a novel range adaptation task, involving either an interleaved or blocked design, to study relative encoding of rewards. In the blocked condition, choice behavior was most consistent with a reference point model in which outcomes are encoded relative to a dynamic estimate of the contextual average reward. In contrast, the interleaved condition was best described by a range-frequency encoding model.
