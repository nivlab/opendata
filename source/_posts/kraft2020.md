Data from a study in which N=100 participants completed three cognitive control tasks requiring different types of cognitive flexibility. The first task was a cognitive task-switching paradigm, requiring participants to classify digits (1 to 9, excluding 5) as either odd or even (parity judgment) or as higher or lower than five (magnitude judgment). The second task was an affective task-switching paradigm, requiring participants to classify faces based on gender (female vs. male; neutral task) and based on valence (positive vs. negative emotional expression). The third task a feedback-based task-switching paradigm with the same rules as the first paradigm, but requiring adjustments to behavior in response to changing feedback. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between the efficiency of cognitive and affective task switching (response time switch costs). Feedback-based flexibility (measured as mean number of errors after rule reversals) did not correlate with task switching efficiency in the other paradigms, but selectively with the effectiveness of affective switching (error rate costs when switching from neutral to emotion task).
