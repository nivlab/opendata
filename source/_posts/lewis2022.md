Data from a study in which N=81 participants completed an effort allocation task, in which participants had to repeatedly press a button to collect food and money tokens. Invigoration and effort maintenance was measured across varying reward magnitudes, difficulty, and reward types. Whereas women and men did not differ in invigoration, women showed higher effort maintenance as well as higher subjective wanting and exertion ratings for small rewards compared with men.
