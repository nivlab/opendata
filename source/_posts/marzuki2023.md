BackgroundCompulsive behaviour is often triggered by Pavlovian cues. Assessing how Pavlovian cues drive instrumental behaviour in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is therefore crucial to understand how compulsions develop and are maintained. An aversive Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm, particularly one involving avoidance/cancellation of negative outcomes, can enable such investigation and has not previously been studied in clinical-OCD. MethodsForty-one participants diagnosed with OCD (21 adults; 20 youths) and 44 controls (21 adults; 23 youths) completed an aversive PIT task. Participants had to cancel unpleasant noises by learning response-outcome (instrumental) and stimulus-outcome (Pavlovian) associations. We then assessed whether Pavlovian cues elicited specific instrumental avoidance responses (specific PIT) and induced general instrumental avoidance (general PIT). We investigated whether task learning and confidence indices influenced PIT strength differentially between groups.ResultsUrge to avoid unpleasant noises and preference for safe over unsafe stimuli influenced specific and general PIT respectively in OCD, while PIT in controls was more influenced by confidence in instrumental and Pavlovian learning. However, there was no overall group difference in PIT performance, although youths with OCD showed weaker specific PIT than youth controls. ConclusionsIn OCD, implicit motivational factors, but not learnt knowledge, contribute to the successful integration of aversive Pavlovian and instrumental cues. This implies that compulsive avoidance may be driven by these automatic processes. Youths with OCD show deficits in specific PIT, suggesting cue integration impairments are only apparent in adolescence. These findings are clinically relevant as they emphasise the importance of targeting such implicit motivational processes when treating OCD.
