abstract: 'When navigating uncertain worlds, humans must balance exploring new options versus exploiting known rewards. Longer horizons and spatially structured option values encourage humans to explore, but the impact of real-world cognitive constraints such as environment size and memory demands on explore-exploit decisions is unclear. In the present study, humans chose between options varying in uncertainty during a multi-armed bandit task with varying environment size and memory demands. Regression and cognitive computational models of choice behavior showed that with a lower cognitive load, humans are more exploratory than a simulated value-maximizing learner, but under cognitive constraints, they adaptively scale down exploration to maintain exploitation. Thus, while humans are curious, cognitive constraints force people to decrease their strategic exploration in a resource-rational-like manner to focus on harvesting known rewards.'

Data from a study in which N=95 participants completed the probabilistic exploration task, in which participants were instructed to maximize winnings by learning which segments of a stimulus were the most likely to provide a reward. The task had a 2 (environment size: 4 or 8 segments) x 2 (memory demands: outcomes for each action in the block shown or hidden) x 2 (initial forced choice trials: even or uneven sampling) design, such that each combination of conditions was consistent throughout each block and was experienced in one block only. With a lower cognitive load, participants were more exploratory than a simulated value-maximizing learner, but under cognitive constraints, they adaptively scaled down exploration to maintain exploitation.
