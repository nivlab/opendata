Data from a study in which N=95 participants completed the probabilistic exploration task, in which participants were instructed to maximize winnings by learning which segments of a stimulus were the most likely to provide a reward. The task had a 2 (environment size: 4 or 8 segments) x 2 (memory demands: outcomes for each action in the block shown or hidden) x 2 (initial forced choice trials: even or uneven sampling) design, such that each combination of conditions was consistent throughout each block and was experienced in one block only. With a lower cognitive load, participants were more exploratory than a simulated value-maximizing learner, but under cognitive constraints, they adaptively scaled down exploration to maintain exploitation.
