Converging evidence has demonstrated that humans exhibit two distinct strategies when learning in complex environments. One is model-free learning, i.e., simple reinforcement of rewarded actions, and the other is model-based learning, which considers the structure of the environment. Recent work has argued that people exhibit little model-based behavior unless it leads to higher rewards. Here we use mouse tracking to study model-based learning in stochastic and deterministic (pattern-based) environments of varying difficulty. In both tasks participants mouse movements reveal that they learned the structures of their environments, despite the fact that standard behavior-based estimates suggested no such learning in the stochastic task. Thus, we argue that mouse tracking can reveal whether subjects have structure knowledge, which is necessary but not sufficient for model-based choice.
