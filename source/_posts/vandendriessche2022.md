Data from a study in which N=56 participants (major depression = 30, healthy controls = 26) completed a a 2-armed bandit task with two different contexts: one 'rich', one 'poor' where both options were associated with an overall positive, negative expected value, respectively. Learning performance followed by a transfer phase, without feedback, were analyzed to disentangle between a decision or a value-update process mechanism.
