abstract: 'Impulsive behaviours are a major contributor to the global burden of disease, but existing measures of cognitive impulsivity have suboptimal reliability and validity. Here, we introduce the Cognitive Impulsivity Suite, comprising three computerized/online tasks using a gamified interface. We conceptualize rapid-response impulsive behaviours (disinhibition) as arising from the failure of three distinct cognitive mechanisms: attentional control, information gathering and monitoring/shifting. We demonstrate the construct and criterion validity of the Cognitive Impulsivity Suite in an online community sample (N = 1,056), show test-retest reliability and between-subjects variability in a face-to-face community sample (N = 63), and replicate the results in a community and clinical sample (N = 578). The results support the theoretical architecture of the attentional control, information gathering and monitoring/shifting constructs. The Cognitive Impulsivity Suite demonstrated incremental criterion validity for prediction of real-world, addiction-related problems and is a promising tool for large-scale research on cognitive impulsivity.'

Data from a study in which N=1697 participants completed a battery of three tasks designed to measure rapid-response impulsive behaviours (disinhibition) as arising from the failure of three distinct cognitive mechanisms: attentional control, information gathering and monitoring/shifting. Data on the Iowa gambling task, beads task, and sustained attention task task was also collected.
