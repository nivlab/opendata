The authors causally tested whether anxiety impacts goal-directed behavior in two experiments (between-subject N=88; within-subject N=50) that used the inhalation of hypercapnic gas (7.5% CO2) to induce an acute state of anxiety in healthy volunteers. In both experiments, anxiety did not affect goal-directed performance.
