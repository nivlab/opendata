Data from a study in which N=161 participants completed a sequential decision-making task similar to the two-step task in which they provided pairwise-similarity ratings on ten novel objects before and after encountering them in the task. Participants who encoded stronger higher-order relationships among choice options showed increased planning and better performance.
