Model-based planning is thought to protect against over-reliance on habits. It is reduced in individuals high in compulsivity, but effect sizes are small and may depend on subtle features of the tasks used to assess it. We developed a diamond-shooting smartphone game that measures model-based planning in an at-home setting, and varied the game's structure within and across participants to assess how it affects measurement reliability and validity with respect to previously established correlates of model-based planning, with a focus on compulsivity. Increasing the number of trials used to estimate model-based planning did remarkably little to affect the association with compulsivity. However, associations with compulsivity were higher when transition ratios were less deterministic and depending on the reward drift utilised. These findings suggest that model-based planning can be measured at home via an app, can be estimated in relatively few trials, and can be optimised for sensitivity to compulsive symptoms in the general population.
