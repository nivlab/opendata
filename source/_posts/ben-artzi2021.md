 178 prolific workers completed an online experiment in return for monetary compensation. Participants completed a Reinforcement Learning task of four cards and two reward conditions. On each trial of the task, two cards of the four were offered by the computer, and participants were asked to pick one. Each card could lead to a reward on an independent drifting probability across trials. The difference between conditions was in whether participants won extra points or avoided the loss of points. All participants completed the OCI-R, and a partial sample also completed BDI, STAI, and SPQ.
