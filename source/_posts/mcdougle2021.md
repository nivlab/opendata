What determines the speed of our decisions? Various models of decision-making have focused on perceptual evidence, past experience, and task complexity as important factors determining the degree of deliberation needed for a decision. Here, we build on a sequential sampling decision-making framework to develop a new model that captures a range of reaction time (RT) effects by accounting for both working memory and instrumental learning processes. The model captures choices and RTs at various stages of learning, and in learning environments with varying complexity. Moreover, the model generalizes from tasks with deterministic reward contingencies to probabilistic ones. The model succeeds in part by incorporating prior uncertainty over actions when modeling RT. This straightforward process model provides a parsimonious account of decision dynamics during instrumental learning and makes unique predictions about internal representations of action values.
