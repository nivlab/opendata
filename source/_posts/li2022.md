Data from a study in which N=329 participants across two experiments (N=199, N=40) completed memorability and value-based choice tasks involving food stimuli. The same stimuli were consistently remembered, and others consistently forgotten, across participants. However, participants did not prefer or choose the more memorable over the less memorable items when choice options were matched for the individuals' valuation of the items.
