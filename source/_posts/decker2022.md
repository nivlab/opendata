Data from a study in which N=53 participants completed a correlated Flanker task in which they categorized central targets (letters or numbers) while ignoring peripheral flanking symbols that shared hidden probabilistic relationships with the targets. Across participants, higher rates of attentional lapses correlated with greater learning of the target-flanker relationships.
