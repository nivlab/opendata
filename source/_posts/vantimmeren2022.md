Data from a study in which N=65 participants completed the symmetrical outcome-revaluation task, which consists of an instrumental training phase followed by an outcome-revaluation test phase during which outcome values were either congruent with training value or incongruent (i.e., devalued or upvalued). For half the participants, a concurrent working memory load was imposed during the test phase. Participants showed evidence for habitual slips-of-action but those under working memory load showed increased habit tendencies.
