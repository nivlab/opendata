The learning rate is a key parameter in reinforcement learning that determines the extent to which novel information (outcome) is incorporated in guiding subsequent actions. Numerous studies have reported that the magnitude of the learning rate in human reinforcement learning is biased depending on the sign of the reward prediction error. However, this asymmetry can be observed as a statistical bias if the fitted model ignores the choice autocorrelation (perseverance), which is independent of the outcomes. Therefore, to investigate the genuine process underlying human choice behavior using empirical data, one should dissociate asymmetry in learning and perseverance from choice behavior. The present study addresses this issue by using a Hybrid model incorporating asymmetric learning rates and perseverance. First, by conducting simulations, we demonstrate that the Hybrid model can identify the true underlying process. Second, using the Hybrid model, we show that empirical data collected from a web-based experiment are governed by perseverance rather than asymmetric learning. Finally, we apply the Hybrid model to two open datasets in which asymmetric learning was reported. As a result, the asymmetric learning rate was validated in one dataset but not another.
