Data from a study in which N=183 participants completed a multi-element perceptual averaging task in which observers made dichotomous judgments about the "average color" (red or blue) of an array of stimuli in trials that varied in the strength (mean) and reliability (variance) of the decision-relevant perceptual evidence. Participants also completed two self-report measures of dimensions of psychosis-proneness.
