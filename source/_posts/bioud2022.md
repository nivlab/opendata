Data from a study in which N=46 participants completed a physical effort task in which participants chose whether to "accept" or "decline" a series of treadmill routes randomly associated to monetary rewards. Participants also provided subjective estimates of energetic cost. Results show that higher monetary prospects led participants to provide higher cost estimates, although reward was independent from effort in the design.
