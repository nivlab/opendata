abstract: 'To decide whether a course of action is worth pursuing, individuals typically weigh its expected costs and benefits. Optimal decision-making relies upon accurate effort cost anticipation, which is generally assumed to be performed independently from goal valuation. In two experiments (n = 46), we challenged this independence principle of standard decision theory. We presented participants with a series of treadmill routes randomly associated to monetary rewards and collected both accept versus decline decisions and subjective estimates of energetic cost. Behavioural results show that higher monetary prospects led participants to provide higher cost estimates, although reward was independent from effort in our design. Among candidate cognitive explanations, they support a model in which prospective cost assessment is biased by the output of an automatic computation adjusting effort expenditure to goal value. This decision bias might lead people to abandon the pursuit of valuable goals that are in fact not so costly to achieve.'

Data from a study in which N=46 participants completed a physical effort task in which participants chose whether to "accept" or "decline" a series of treadmill routes randomly associated to monetary rewards. Participants also provided subjective estimates of energetic cost. Results show that higher monetary prospects led participants to provide higher cost estimates, although reward was independent from effort in the design.
