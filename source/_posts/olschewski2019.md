Data from a study in which N=231 participants completed a decisions from experience paradigm. Participants were required to state their certainty equivalents for different outcome distributions from which they could sample. The results indicate that participants valued random number distributions below their respective arithmetic means and valued distributions as lower when their variance increased, indicating risk aversion. A similar though less pronounced pattern also occurred in the matched mean estimation task where accuracy was incentivized and preferences played no role. These patterns suggest that seemingly risk-averse preferences are partly due to cognitive biases when perceiving and estimating numbers.
