abstract: 'Working memory deficits are common in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression-two common neurodevelopmental disorders with overlapping cognitive profiles but distinct clinical presentation. Multivariate techniques have previously been utilized to understand working memory processes in functional brain networks in healthy adults but have not yet been applied to investigate how working memory processes within the same networks differ within typical and atypical developing populations. We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to identify whether brain networks discriminated between spatial versus verbal working memory processes in ADHD and Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD). Thirty-six male clinical participants and 19 typically developing (TD) boys participated in a fMRI scan while completing a verbal and a spatial working memory task. Within a priori functional brain networks (frontoparietal, default mode, salience), the TD group demonstrated differential response patterns to verbal and spatial working memory. The PDD group showed weaker differentiation than TD, with lower classification accuracies observed in primarily the left frontoparietal network. The neural profiles of the ADHD and PDD differed specifically in the SN where the ADHD groups neural profile suggests significantly less specificity in neural representations of spatial and verbal working memory. We highlight within-group classification as an innovative tool for understanding the neural mechanisms of how cognitive processes may deviate in clinical disorders, an important intermediary step towards improving translational psychiatry.'
