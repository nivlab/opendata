Data from a study in which N=74 participants completed perifoveal Stroop task with emotional priming and changes of the probabilistic context. On each trial, target stimuli of a spatial Stroop task were preceded by sad or neutral facial expressions, providing two emotional conditions. To manipulate the requirement of both proactive and reactive control, the proportion of congruent trials (PC) was varied at the list-wide (LWPC) and item-specific (ISPC) levels, respectively. Sad priming led to behavioral costs only in trials with low proactive and reactive cognitive control exertion.
