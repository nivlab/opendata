Data from a study in which N=60 participants completed the Traffic Light Task (TLT) and self-report questionnaire measures of apathy and impulsivity. Although the two traits were positively correlated in questionnaire assessments, they were associated with distinct behavioural signatures on the task. Impulsivity was expressed as an inflexible tendency to generate rapid anticipatory responses, regardless of task context. Apathy, on the other hand, was associated with a blunted effect of reward on response vigour.
