#### State Anxiety Biases Estimates of Uncertainty in Volatile Environments and Impairs Reward Learning

In the study, both a state anxious and a control group learned probabilistic stimulus-outcome mappings in a volatile task environment while the authors recorded their electrophysiological (EEG) signals. State anxiety was associated with an underestimation of environmental and informational uncertainty, and an increase in uncertainty about volatility estimates.
