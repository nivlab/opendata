Data from a study in which N=209 participants across two experiments (N=114, N=95) completed a 2-arm bandit task where one option provided larger rewards in the long-run but had greater variability around the mean rewards (the high-uncertainty option) and the other option provided smaller rewards in the long-term but the rewards varied less (the low-uncertainty option). Participants were exposed to either the SECPT or a warm-water control condition before completing the task. Compared to the control condition, those exposed to the acute stress manipulation chose the high-uncertainty option that provided highly variable but larger rewards over the option that provided stable, smaller rewards.
