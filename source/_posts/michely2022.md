Data from a study in which N=66 participants twice completed a risk-sensitive gambling card game: once after acute (single-dose) and once after prolonged (week-long) daily administration of the SSRI citalopram or placebo. Participants also completed multiple self-report questionnaires measuring affective state. Prolonged boosting of serotonin was observed to enhance learning from punishment and reduce learning from reward.
