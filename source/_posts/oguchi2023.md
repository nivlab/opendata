Humans form complex societies in which we routinely engage in social decision-making regarding the allocation of resources among ourselves and others. One dimension that characterizes social decision-making in particular is whether to prioritize self-interest or respect for others-proself or prosocial. What causes this individual difference in social value orientation? Recent developments in the social dual-process theory argue that social decision-making is characterized by its underlying domain-general learning systems: the model-free and model-based systems. In line with this learning approach, we propose and experimentally test the hypothesis that differences in social preferences stem from which learning system is dominant in an individual. Here, we used a non-social state transition task that allowed us to assess the balance between model-free/model-based learning and investigate its relation to the social value orientations. The results showed that proselfs depended more on model-based learning, whereas prosocials depended more on model-free learning. Reward amount and reaction time analyses showed that proselfs learned the task structure earlier in the session than prosocials, reflecting their difference in model-based/model-free learning dependence. These findings support the learning hypothesis on what makes differences in social preferences and have implications for understanding the mechanisms of prosocial behavior.
