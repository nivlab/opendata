Data from a study in which N=166 participants across two experiments (N=40, N=126) completed a sequential sampling task involving a certain and an uncertain option in order to investigate how sensitive participants were to each sample of information during a preferential choice vs. a perceptual decision making task. A subset of participants also completed several self-report measures of risk preferences and the balloon analog risk task.
