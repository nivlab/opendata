Data from a study in which N=157 participants across two experiments (N=82, N=75) completed a multi-arm bandit card-sorting game where, on each trial, they sorted a card into one of three boxes. Their goal was to use reward feedback to learn which box to sort each card into. The sorting rule changed across blocks, and participants were made explicitly aware of what the sorting rule for every block.  Participants were slower and less accurate in learning correct choices of a general format compared with learning more concrete motor actions. Slowed learning was attributable to weaker working memory use, rather than slowed RL.
