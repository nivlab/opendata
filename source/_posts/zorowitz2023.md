Data from N=149 participants who completed a gamified version of the two-step task under one of three conditions: (1) stimuli from both first- and second-state choices were randomly assigned to right/left positions on the screen on every trial; (2) stimuli from both first- and second-state choices were assigned fixed right/left positions on the screen (i.e., unchanging across trials); or (3) stimuli from first-state choices were randomly assigned to right/left positions on the screen on every trial. Second-state stimuli were assigned fixed right/left positions on the screen (i.e., unchanging across trials).
