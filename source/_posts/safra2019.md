Data from N=200 participants who took part in an experiment involving reward learning in contexts with different levels of social information (absent, partial and complete). Behavioral analyses revealed a specific detrimental effect of depressive symptoms (but not anxiety) on behavioral performance in the presence of social information, i.e. when participants were informed about the choices of another player.
