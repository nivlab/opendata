Data from a study in which N=54 participants (N=27 pairs of adults) completed a novel economic game, the Space Dilemma, which capitalizes on a well-known economic principle controlling the spatial location of competitors in duopoly and generalizes to a continuum the trade-off between cooperation and competition which is dichotomized in the Prisoner's Dilemma. In the Space Dilemma game, players change their degree of cooperativeness over time in cooperative and competitive contexts.
