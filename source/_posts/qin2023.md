Data from a study in which N=106 participants across two experiments (N=48, N=58) completed a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) task designed to examine how the environment can trigger goal-directed behavior. Specifically, the tasks explored the PIT effect when the outcomes were framed in terms of self- versus other-interest. Participants performed actions to earn money for themselves or a charity. The results showed that a cue predictive of self-interest outcomes facilitated responses instrumental in gaining the outcome, while such specific PIT effect for other-interest outcomes only emerged when participants were free to donate the money.
