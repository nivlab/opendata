## Anxiety

### Bach (2015)
{: .no_toc }
*Anxiety-like behavioural inhibition is normative under environmental threat-reward correlations*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004646
Data repository: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.bd4gs
```

The authors test a model of behavioral inhibition acros four experiments with human participants. Humans exhibit behavioural inhibition with a strong linear dependence on threat probability and magnitude. Individual trait anxiety scores predict behavioural inhibition, underlining the validity of this anxiety model.

*Neural computations of threat in the aftermath of combat trauma*
```
Publications(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0315-x
Data repository: https://osf.io/rxsw2/
```

By combining computational, morphological, and functional analyses, this study relates latent markers of associative threat learning to overt post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in combat veterans. Using reversal learning, the authors found that symptomatic veterans showed greater physiological adjustment to cues that did not predict what they had expected, indicating greater sensitivity to prediction errors for negative outcomes. This exaggerated weighting of prediction errors shapes the dynamic learning rate (associability) and value of threat predictive cues.

### Robinson et al. (2019)

*Altered learning under uncertainty in unmedicated mood and anxiety disorders*
```
Publications(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-019-0628-0
Data repository: https://osf.io/ub6j7/
```

The authors studied the computational basis of learning under uncertainty in healthy individuals and individuals suffering from a mix of mood and anxiety disorders. Participants were asked to choose between four competing slot machines with fluctuating reward and punishment outcomes during safety and stress. Overall, the data suggest that anxious individuals are quicker to update their behaviour in response to negative outcomes (increased punishment learning rates).

### Gillan et al. (2020)
{: .no_toc }
*Experimentally-induced and real-world acute anxiety have no effect on goal-directed behaviour*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720000203
Data repository: https://osf.io/w4yfp/
```

The authors causally tested whether anxiety impacts goal-directed behavior in two experiments (between-subject N=88; within-subject N=50) that used the inhalation of hypercapnic gas (7.5% CO2) to induce an acute state of anxiety in healthy volunteers. In both experiments, anxiety did not affect goal-directed performance.

### Lamba et al. (2020)

*Anxiety Impedes Adaptive Social Learning Under Uncertainty*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797620910993
Data repository: https://osf.io/ea67f/
```
Using a dynamic trust game and a matched nonsocial task, the authors found that healthy subjects (n = 257) were particularly good at learning under negative social uncertainty. In contrast, subjects with anxiety (n = 97) overinvested in exploitative partners.

### Hein et al. (2021)

*State Anxiety Biases Estimates of Uncertainty in Volatile Environments and Impairs Reward Learning*
```
Publications(s): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117424
Data repository: https://osf.io/b4qkp/
```

In the study, both a state anxious and a control group learned probabilistic stimulus-outcome mappings in a volatile task environment while the authors recorded their electrophysiological (EEG) signals. State anxiety was associated with an underestimation of environmental and informational uncertainty, and an increase in uncertainty about volatility estimates.

*Multiple Dissociations Between Comorbid Depression and Anxiety on Reward and Punishment Processing: Evidence From Computationally Informed EEG*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1162/cpsy_a_00024
Data repository: https://bit.ly/2F11Zwv
```

Highly symptomatic depressed individuals (N = 46) completed a probabilistic learning task with concurrent EEG. Measures of anxiety and depression symptomatology were significantly correlated with each other; however, only anxiety predicted better avoidance learning due to a tighter coupling of negative prediction error signaling with punishment-specific EEG features. In contrast, depression predicted a smaller reward-related EEG feature, but this did not affect prediction error coupling or the ability to learn from reward.

### Safra et al. (2019)
{: .no_toc }
*Depressive symptoms are associated with blunted reward learning in social contexts*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007224
Data repository: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8199293
```

Data from N=200 participants who took part in an experiment involving reward learning in contexts with different levels of social information (absent, partial and complete). Behavioral analyses revealed a specific detrimental effect of depressive symptoms (but not anxiety) on behavioral performance in the presence of social information, i.e. when participants were informed about the choices of another player.

The authors show that DBS' effect is explained in part by enhancement of PFC-driven cognitive control. DBS improves human subjects' performance on a cognitive control task and increases theta (5–8Hz) oscillations in both medial and lateral PFC. The theta increase predicts subjects' clinical outcomes.

## Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

### Marton et al. (2019)
{: .no_toc }
*Validating a dimension of doubt in decision-making: A proposed endophenotype for obsessive-compulsive disorder*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218182
Data repository: https://archive.data.jhu.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7281/T1/DP2U9M
```

Doubt is a prominent feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The authors developed a new instrument, the Doubt Questionnaire, to clinically assess doubt, and evaluated its psychometric properties. The random dot motion task was used to measure reaction time and subjective certainty, at varying levels of perceptual difficulty, in individuals who scored high and low on doubt, and in individuals with and without OCD. Compared to those with low doubt, those with high doubt accumulate evidence more slowly and report lower certainty when making decisions under conditions of low uncertainty.

### Fradkin et al. (2020)

*Doubting what you already know: Uncertainty regarding state transitions is associated with obsessive compulsive symptoms*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007634
Data repository: https://osf.io/d6b3m/
```

The authors investigated the relationship between OC symptoms and transition uncertainty in a reversal learning task. Participants with higher OC symptoms exhibited increased transition uncertainty, as well as a pattern of behavior potentially indicative of a difficulty in relying on learned contingencies, with no evidence for perseverative behavior.

*Working Memory Related Brain Network Connectivity in Individuals with Schizophrenia and Their Siblings*
```
Publications(s): https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2012.00137
Data repository: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000115/
```

The authors assessed functional connectivity during rest and during three working memory loads of an N-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) among: (1) individuals with schizophrenia (N = 19); (2) the siblings of individuals with schizophrenia (N = 28); (3) healthy controls (N = 10); and (4) the siblings of healthy controls (N = 17).

*Reduction of Pavlovian Bias in Schizophrenia: Enhanced Effects in Clozapine-Administered Patients*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152781
Data repository: https://zenodo.org/record/29601
```

45 patients with schizophrenia and 30 demographically-matched controls completed the Pavlovian instrumental transfer task. Patients demonstrated a reduction in Pavlovian performance bias that was evident in a reduced Go bias across the full group. In a subset of patients administered clozapine, the reduction in Pavlovian bias was enhanced.

## Transdiagnostic

### Gillan et al. (2016)
{: .no_toc }
*Characterizing a psychiatric symptom dimension related to deficits in goal-directed control*
```
Publications(s): http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11305.001
Data repository: https://osf.io/usdgt/
```

The authors investigated whether a dimensional approach would better delineate the clinical manifestations of goal-directed deficits. Using large-scale online assessment of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive performance in two independent general-population samples, they found that deficits in goal-directed control were most strongly associated with a symptom dimension comprising compulsive behavior and intrusive thought.

*Transdiagnostic Phenotyping Reveals a Host of Metacognitive Deficits Implicated in Compulsivity*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59646-4
Data repository: https://osf.io/2z6tw/
```

The authors aimed to test the precise computations that underlie the disconnection between metacogniton and compulsivity. They phenotyped a large general population sample (N = 437), who completed a predictive inference task and found that decreases in action-confidence coupling were not only associated with OCD symptoms, but also several other clinical phenotypes (6/9 corrected for multiple comparisons). This non-specific pattern was explained by a transdiagnostic compulsive symptom dimension. Action-confidence decoupling in high compulsives was associated with a marked inability to update confidence estimates (but not behaviour) according to unexpected outcomes, uncertainty and positive feedback. The findings suggest that compulsive behaviour may be explained by difficulty in building an accurate explicit model of the world.

*A dimensional investigation of error-related negativity (ERN) and self-reported psychiatric symptoms*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2020.09.019
Data repository: https://osf.io/vjda6/
```

The authors recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) from 196 participants who performed the Flanker task and collected scores on 9 questionnaires assessing psychiatric symptoms. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found non-significant associations between ERN amplitude and symptom severity of OCD, trait anxiety, depression, social anxiety, impulsivity, eating disorders, alcohol addiction, schizotypy and apathy.
