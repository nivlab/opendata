# Contributing to OpenData
Contributions to OpenData are welcome! All of the code is managed through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nivlab/opendata).

## How to submit a dataset

There are three main ways you can submit a dataset for entry to OpenData, which are described in turn below. Note that they are ranked in order of preference, from most preferred to least preferred, by the maintainers of Open Data :)

### Submit a pull request

To directly add a dataset yourself, you can open a pull request on Github. First you should fork the OpenData library via GitHub and make modifications on your fork. The OpenData database is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) using a standardized, easy-to-copy template. Once your modification is complete, submit a pull request to merge your changes into the docs branch of OpenData. Pull requests will be reviewed by the maintainers.

### Open an issue

To advertise a dataset for entry into the database, you can open a [new issue via GitHub](https://github.com/nivlab/opendata/issues/new). Please provide a link to a repository for the data and, if available, a link to a corresponding manuscript describing the data.

### Email the maintainers

A third and final way to advertise a dataset for entry into the database is to email the maintainers directly ([zorowitz@princeton.edu](<mailto:zorowitz@princeton.edu>)). Please provide a link to a repository for the data and, if available, a link to a corresponding manuscript describing the data.
